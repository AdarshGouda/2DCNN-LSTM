Also see the report folder for plots.**\n","\n","A side note: In config file I have grab_frame = 80 but the prepare_raw_data_Processed.py file is grabbing only 40 frames i think. Its because I had set a boolean variable called \"alternate\" that grabs alternate frames. Thats why you see 1/40 ... 40/40 in the traain output. I need to troubleshoot it to see if its grabbing 40 frames or 80. Based on the accuracy, I think 80 frames are grabbed but its showing 40 count because of tqdm on for loop and the while loop inside the for loop is not recorded by tqdm."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":35125,"status":"ok","timestamp":1650896548956,"user":{"displayName":"Halim
